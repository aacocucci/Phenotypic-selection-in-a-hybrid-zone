# Phenotypic-selection-in-a-hybrid-zone
Data used in the forthcoming article  NPH-MS-2024-46244 "Phenotypic selection patterns in a hybrid zone between two Calceolaria species with contrasting pollinators: insights from field surveys and fitness assessments"

Phenotypic traits consist of:

Plant height of each sampled (height) measured as as the distance from the ground to the highest flower
Flower shape in lateral view obtained by a landmark-based geometric morphometrics approach. The first two axes of a Principal Component Analysis retrieve 91.62% of shape variation and the first axis (PC1) retrieves 83.84% of this variation. 
Operative distance (OD) was obtained from the morphogeometric database by calculating the Euclidean distances between landmarks 1 and 7 using the Procrustes-corrected coordinates adjusted by the centroid size.
These variables were renamed as height.1, OD.1, and PC1.1 after scaling to zero mean and unit sd.


Fitness measures consist of:

Proportion of flowers visited by birds (pbi).
Proportion of flowers visited by bees (pbee).
Number of pollen grains deposited on the stigma (G).
Number of pollen tubes germinated in the style (T).
Estimated mean number of pollen grains deposited by birds (Gbi).
Estimated mean number of pollen grains deposited by bees (Gbee).
Estimated number of pollen tubes coming from pollen deposited by birds (Tbi).
Estimated number of pollen tubes coming from pollen deposited by bees (Tbee).
Proportion between germinated pollen tubes and deposited pollen grains (T/G), only for individuals with G>0.

Seven of the above fitness measures were scaled to the population mean and renamed as: w.pbi, w.pbee, w.Gbi, w.Gbee, w.Tbi, w.Tbee, and w.T/G.
